# CS400-Projects
The repository records all the projects and activities from CS400 Summer at UW-Madison

## Project 1 - Rotation
This project involves enhancing the RedBlackTree class, which currently operates as a regular binary search tree. The primary goal is to implement tree rotations, laying the groundwork for a future transition to a self-balancing Red-Black tree.

## Project 2 - RedBlackTree Insertion
In this project, we will enhance the RedBlackTree class to support the Red-Black Tree Insertion operation. It builds upon the previous work involving tree rotations.

## Project 3 - HashTable
This project revolves around the implementation of a HashtableMap that uses open addressing with linear probing for handling hash collisions. The class must adhere to the provided MapADT. At the same time, three JUnit tests methods are included.

## Project 4 - Dijkstra
Implement Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm using the provided data structure, ensuring code is entirely original.
